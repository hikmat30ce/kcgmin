<p>Dear ${consumerFullName},</p>

<p>As requested, your protection plan is attached to this email.  Please read it
   carefully to familiarize yourself with everything it covers, as well as issues
   (like wear and tear or manufacturer's warranty issues) that are not covered by the plan.</p> 

<p>We recommend you print a copy of the plan, attach it to your store receipt,
   and put both in a safe place. You'll need these if you ever request service.
   If you cannot open either PDF document, <a href='http://get.adobe.com/reader/'>
